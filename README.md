# Twitter-WebApp
A Twitter-based web app created using Python, during my final year studying computer science.

* hidden.py file has been removed for security reasons *

In order to run this app, create your own file called 'hidden.py' with the following lines of code:

def oauth() : return { "consumer_key" : "YOUR OWN KEY", "consumer_secret" : "YOUR OWN SECRET HERE", "token_key" : "YOUR OWN TOKEN HERE", "token_secret" : "YOUR OWN TOKEN SECRET HERE" }
